# Conclusion

I enjoyed this CTF. It was a good mix of challenges: OSINT, reverse engineering, binary
analysis. It did expose a few weaknesses in my tool belt, namely binary exploitation & 
overflows. I've got a long way to go and much to learn. 

Thank you to the team at [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/) for putting this 
on. I hope this becomes an annual thing, as I'd like a shot at the adversaries again 
next year. PROTECTIVE PENGUIN will fall next time.
